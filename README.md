# A Theoretical Framework for Hyper-Adaptive Biological State Coherence Under Extreme Systemic Failure

## üìñ Abstract

This repository contains the theoretical framework, supporting analysis, and supplementary information for the paper investigating a highly improbable medical outcome: the survival of an individual following prolonged, unmanaged septic shock with zero detectable neurological deficit. The work proposes a theoretical mechanism, the **Quantum-Coherent Biological Reset (QCBR)**, integrating concepts from quantum biology and extreme hypometabolism.

## üí° Core Model: The QCBR Mechanism

The central hypothesis posits that this extreme systemic failure may trigger a non-linear survival mechanism requiring the co-activation of:
1.  **The Tardigrade Protocol:** Latent, protective biological pathways enabling extreme hypometabolism.
2.  **Non-Local Consciousness Re-Coupling:** Informational guidance challenging established materialist paradigms.

All mathematical models and equations are detailed within the full paper.
